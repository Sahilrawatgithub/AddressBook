# ðŸ“’ Address Book System

Welcome to the **Address Book System** project!  
This program demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts in **C#**, along with advanced features such as **File I/O**, **Database interactions**, **Cloud Server integration**, and **Multi-Threading**.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Outcome

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Work with File Handles (**File I/O**)
- Perform operations using **Databases**
- Save data to a **Cloud Server**
- Use **Multi-Threading** for I/O or network calls

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

- **IDE**: Visual Studio  
- **Language**: C#  
- **Version Control**: Git  
- **Branch Strategy**: Every **Use Case (UC)** is implemented in a separate Git branch and merged into the `main` branch.  
- **Code Hygiene**: Follows naming conventions, indentation, and clean code practices.  
- **Review Guidelines**: Git check-in comments and version history are monitored.
